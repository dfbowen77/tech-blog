# tech-blog
This repo represents my submission for the module 14 challenge to make a tech blog following the model-view-controller paradigm.  

## Description
The following program is designed to meet the requirements of the Module 14 Challenge. It represents the beginnings of a technology blog. The web application was made using the model-view-controller paradigm for web development. Users can login, logout, or signup for using the blog. Prior to logging in, users can view the blog posts and see user comments. Once logged in they can create new blog posts, update or delete old blog posts, or make comments on existing posts.
